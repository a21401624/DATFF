# Dual Attention Transformer Fusion (DATFF) Module 

This is the code for our paper 'Dual Attention Feature Fusion for Visible-Infrared Object Detection' that has been submitted to ICANN2023.

Note that we only include the code for DroneVehicle dataset. The config file of FLIR dataset will be released soon.

More details will be updated upon the acceptance of this paper.

## About the code

Our code is build on mmrotate==0.3.4. We only present the modifications we have made to the mmrotate codebase. So you should put the python files under right locations and
register them in '\_\_init\_\_.py'.
